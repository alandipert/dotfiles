# dotfiles

My dotfiles. I clone this on machines I use and type `make` to synchronize the
`dotfiles` directory to the home directory, prepending each file with a dot.

Depends on [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

Installation:

    git clone https://github.com/alandipert/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && make
